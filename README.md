# chess_openings_teacher
A mini chess engine to practice my openings, my LLM knowledge and my Vue.js skills.

The idea is to have a fully playable board of chess (this step has been completed), where you can ask an LLM about the moves it recommends for a particular opening as a normal engine plays the other player.
